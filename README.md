# Strapi example

This example deploys self-hosted version of [Strapi](https://strapi.io/). Internally it uses a PostgreSQL database to store the data.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/strapi?referralCode=milo)

## ✨ Features

- Strapi
- Postgres

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Click the Railway button 👆
- Add the environment variables
  - If you choose not to add the Cloudinary related environment variables, your media will not be persisted between deploys.

## 💻 Developing locally

When developing locally this Strapi template will connect to the Postgres server from its public [TCP Proxy](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/exposing-your-app#tcp-proxying)

- Clone the repository locally
- Install the dependencies with `pnpm install` (requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), or run `corepack enable` — Node ships Corepack and will use the pinned version from `package.json`)
- Install the Railway CLI, instructions for that can be found [here](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli#installation)
    - If this is your first time using the CLI make sure to login with `railway login`
- Within the local repository run `railway link` to link the local repository to the Strapi service on Railway
- Start Strapi for development with `railway run pnpm run develop`
    - This command run Strapi in development mode with the service variables available locally
- Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:1337/admin`

## 📝 Notes

- After your app is deployed, visit the `/admin` endpoint to create your admin user.
- Railway's filesystem is ephemeral which is why any changes to the filesystem are not persisted between deploys. This is why, this template uses Cloudinary for media storage.
